# Pointcloud (Proof of Concept)
Repo for trying out some pointcloud stuff, and working with cmake / ros / launch files

Current todo's:
* Parameter sweep gmapping, see if I can get more precision
* cleaning up code
* look into more (usefull) parameterization
* add a way to include label info
* add a way to color labels (in the pointcloud)
* multithread the internal process (it seems to be slow single thread)
